# WxBlender
Allows the user to blend multiple images with different opacities

HOW TO USE:
1. Download the .html file somewhere locally on your hard drive

2. (Optional:) By all means, open the file in a text editor and review what the html and javascript is doing.  (good, safe practice when downloading anything like this from the internet)

3. Open the file by either double clicking or pasting the path into your browser. 
    (This has been tested with Chrome - let me know if there are issues with other browsers)

4. Paste the URL of an image into a text box and Tab or click out of the text box to load the image.
     Note: The URL must be directly to an image file (ex. jpg, png, gif, etc). It can NOT be to an html page that is displaying an image.

5. Use the sliders to adjust the opacity of that image


CURRENT LIMITATIONS
1. You cannot right-click and open the blended image in a new Tab
2. You cannot right-click and Save Image As. Use a screenshot tool if you want to download
